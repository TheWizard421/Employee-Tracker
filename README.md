# Employee Tracker

## Description
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are known as Content Management Systems (CMS). Your challenge this week 
is to build a command-line application to manage a company's database of employees using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria below being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

## User Story
